# Qt-Examples

Being sick of inventing the wheel for th 365. time when coding with Qt, I started this Repo as a place to keep things together.
This repo contains different examples on how to solve things with Qt.

In order to use the code, you should have installed Qt by Trolltech. While most of the examples compile fine using Qt5, I strongly recomment you to use a recent, stable Qt6 release.
